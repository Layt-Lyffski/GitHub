  commands:

      // if you have access to physical hardware you can set and collet a lot of logs if you want to (Logical not possible)


<SSH>
  commands:
    #ip domain-name {name}

<PORT MIRRORING> //function to copy date from port to another port for diagnose the traffic of network && analysis to search error
  commands:
    #monitor session 1 source interface fastEthernet {prot e.g 0/1} //default read and write
    #monitor session 1 destinatino int //goal where you want the date to go
    #monioor session 1 source vlan {num} //you can monitor all with sniffer


<EtherChannel||LinkggregatioPort> //connet two physical port into one logical port → 2 active even through FTP working
  using Static → without protocol, without additional movement in network
    command:
      #interface range fastEthernet {port}
      #channel-group 1 mode ? //max 6 groups to max 8 port (12.5% port load) have to even number; mode ? (=get overview) → for static use "on" mode; + others are for non-static
      #show etherechannel //see result
  using Dynamic → with protocol |→ PaGP (=port aggregation protocol) for cisco || LACP (=Link Aggregation Control Protocol) &forall
    commands:
      #channel-group 1 mode auto||desirable //for dynamic using PaGP:= it use auto||desirable (=do not really matter which one)
      #show etherchannel //see result
